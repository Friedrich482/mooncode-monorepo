## Description
This project is the dashboard used to display analytical data locally. It is served by the [vscode-extension](../vscode-extension) on `http://localhost:4208` (or any near available port). Built on top of [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and powered by [trpc](https://trpc.io/).

## Project setup

To run the dashboard, you need to first clone the repository: 
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Friedrich482/mooncode-monorepo.git
```
Then `cd` in the dashboard:

```bash
cd apps/dashboard
```
Then install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Before continuing you'll need some environment variables: `VITE_API_URL`, `VITE_LOGIN_URL` and `VITE_REGISTER_URL`.
Create a `.env.development` : 

```bash
VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:3000/trpc"
VITE_LOGIN_URL="http://localhost:3000/trpc/auth.signInUser"
VITE_REGISTER_URL="http://localhost:3000/trpc/auth.registerUser"
```
So to properly run the dashboard in development, the [API](../api) must be also running on `http://localhost:3000`. Then run 

```bash
npm run dev
```
and open `http://localhost:4208` (or the near available port).

### Production

To build for production: 
Create a `.env.production` with the same variables as in development and adapt them depending of your API:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=...
VITE_LOGIN_URL=...
VITE_REGISTER_URL=...
```
Then build with: 
```bash
npm run build
```
